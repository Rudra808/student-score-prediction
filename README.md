# Student Score Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## Overview
This project predicts student exam scores based on study hours using Linear Regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Model Performance
The model achieved an R² score of **0.96** on the test dataset using an 80-20 train-test split.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the project:
   python main.py
   
## Description
The model learns the relationship between hours studied and exam score,
